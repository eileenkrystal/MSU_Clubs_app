With the support of the Black Student Alliance, as well as black faculty and staff, they founded the Black Celebratory formerly known as African American Celebratory. Black Celebratory is known for hosting the traditional cultural event of Black Graduation on Michigan State University's campus. Black Celebratory received both local and national support for acknowledging the accomplishments of black students in its first active year. However, with support came criticism. Nevertheless, the organization continues to productively celebrate the graduation of black students. Over the years, the goals of the MSUBC have expanded to include community outreach and service learning engagement. Black Graduation is a ceremony focused around Michigan State University’s Black student’s accomplishment of successfully completing an undergraduate, graduate, or doctoral degree from Michigan State University. Black Graduation represents the culture of our students, support of our communities, and excellence in scholarship. A cultural rite of passage that acknowledges all prospective graduates and in no way is a replacement ceremony to Michigan State’s yearly commencement. While sharing in the values of scholarship, community, integrity, and black excellence in all student experiences; Black Grad concludes each ceremony with a Kente-Stole accolade dedicated to the current class of graduates from Michigan State University Contact Information Address Contact Email E: rso.aac@msu.edu", "emails": ["rso.aac@msu.edu"], "email": "rso.aac@msu.edu", "phone": null, "address": null, "contacts_raw": "", "categories": [], "socials": {"instagram": "https://www.instagram.com/msu_bc/", "facebook": null, "twitter": null, "linkedin": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/black-celebratory-87ab27295/", "website": "https://msublackcelebratory.weebly.com/about.html"}}

Our goal here at ACF - MSU is to lead young people into a saving relationship with Jesus Christ, and help them embrace His call to discipleship. The mission of the Adventist Youth Fellowship organization can be combined into these four objectives: To equip and inspire young people to be Christian ambassadors to their respective places of work and study through Biblical training, Christian fellowship, network opportunities, and leadership responsibilities To mobilize existing youth and young adult ministries that are fully committed to the distinctive message and mission of the Adventist Church towards the proclamation of the Three Angels’ Messages To provide a support system for Adventist students studying on non-Adventist universities To establish university churches (Uchurches) that see reaching the public campus as one of their primary ministry responsibilities, and integrate public campus ministry into the ministry of the local church. The ACF group at Michigan State University strives to carry out this mission through weekly Bible studies, prayer groups, outreach programs, networking opportunities, and numerous social events hosted on and off the Michigan State University campus. Our organization also frequently partners with CAMPUS (Center for Adventist Ministry to Public University Students) which is a department that focuses solely on ministry on secular university and college campuses.

Each year, we perform a research project--either an original design or one that branches off of current work in the department--and present our results in the Animal Science Undergraduate Research Forum (ASURF) and University Undergraduate Research and Arts Forum (UURAF). Students in our club form lasting connections with their peers, deeper connections with faculty, and have increased opportunities to gain a position as a research assistant. We are open to all undergraduate students. Whether you are interested in veterinary school, graduate school, medical school, industry, or are undecided, forming an intimate connection with research and the research process is a valuable experience that carries lasting lessons and skills development--both inside and outside of a laboratory setting.

We handle bugs, do activities like eating bugs, bug bingo, painting with bugs, bug pictionary, and learn about bugs in pop culture, how to take care of pet bugs, and careers in entomology. Our meetings are fun for everyone regardless of knowledge/experience level. Our members create a safe and kind atmosphere encouraging self expression. This is the nature of our organization as we attract those who are capable of looking past irrational fears of bugs which are normalized by our society to see the beauty and value in these misunderstood creatures. Most metings occur at the MSU Bug House where members are surrounded by live and preserved exotic insects and relatives. Our activities provide a way to relax, learn, be creative, and socialize with other kind hearted students at your own pace. Bug Club has no commitments, dues, or obligations. Members attend meetings with activities they find interesting and are expected to be respectful of our live insects and other members.

We host Small Groups all over campus every week and have a weekly meeting known as Real Life. You can learn more about who Cru is below. Get Connected at cruatstate.com Cru is a student-led community passionate about connecting people to Jesus Christ. College is an opportunity in most students’ lives to learn who they are and what they value most. In these years many students experience new things in search of their identity and purpose in life. Cru is a caring group of students who want to listen and learn from one another about what each journey has looked like, and what is being discovered along the way. Cru believes the most important part of this journey is discovering and growing in a relationship with God. We believe we are broken, sinful individuals separated from a holy loving God, but that God sent Jesus as the only way to restore relationship to Him. Believing in Jesus’ life, death, and resurrection allows us to know God personally. We seek to be a community that supports and nurtures others as they explore and pursue their faith. There are inevitable points of confusion where people may question what they thought was true both of the world around them and of themselves individually. Many are not looking for someone to solve all of their problems, but someone who will listen and let them know they are not crazy for having questions. Cru desires to be a community that journeys with you and your relationship with God, sharing experiences of Biblical grace and truth with you that will last a lifetime. Not only this, but we believe God put you where you are for a reason and he has a plan for your life that will impact others at MSU and beyond. It is our hope that as you grow in a Christ-centered community, you will be better equipped and prepared for life after college. We are Michigan State students helping students know Jesus, care for each other, and grow in their faith.

Our program connects English-speaking volunteers with English learners abroad for weekly videochat conversations. In just 1 hour a week, our volunteers make a huge impact - helping their students break the language barrier, offering friendship and emotional support, and introducing them to a new culture. OUR VISION Through direct conversation, we facilitate mutually beneficial relationships between students and volunteers, creating a virtuous cycle of growth and understanding. And by doing this at an unprecedented scale - 48,000 participants and counting - we help emerging democracies connect with the global community, breaking down borders and catalyzing economic and social development. HOW IT WORKS We currently work with motivated Ukrainians of all ages and volunteers age 13-85+ located worldwide. We screen every learner and volunteer to ensure their fit for the program, and provide training and orientation. ​ Participants are matched either one-on-one or in mini-groups with two or more learners based on their preferences, interests, and availability to ensure an effective and mutually enjoyable communication experience. After a match is made, students and volunteers begin conducting weekly online speaking sessions. ENGin supports participants throughout their time in the program with tips, resources, and problem resolution.

This stunning statistic allows us to only begin to grasp the massive impact that cancer has on the lives of nearly every American. Perhaps even more staggering is that this statistic only represents the individuals directly affected with cancer. It does not account for the obstacles that patients with cancer experience during diagnosis, treatment, and even survivorship for those who do not succumb to the disease. It does not illustrate the impact of this diagnosis on the friends and family of those affected. It does not address the fact that, with such a stunning lifetime incidence, physicians in every medical and surgical specialty will encounter patients with cancer. An osteopathic student organization must represent these factors with the same level of importance as it represents not only the disease, but also the specialty itself. This is why we believe that oncology deserves its own organizational platform. Through HOOSA, we aim to provide opportunities in education, networking, shadowing, mentorship, research, and public service. These opportunities benefit osteopathic students who are interested in medical, surgical, and radiation oncology in addition to hematology, cancer rehabilitation, and cancer genetics. Moreover, we aim to holistically represent the challenges, including but not limited to those that non-oncology physicians will face. This includes their direct encounters with cancer patients, the impact of cancer on current patients and their families, and the obstacles experienced by cancer survivors.

This club aims to focus on these broader, strategic aspects of organizations. We will explore company examples and walk through real-life scenarios while hearing from seasoned MSU alumni who can speak to current trends and lessons learned during their time in the workforce.

But none of these scenarios could exist without the strategic thinking of the Human Resources department. As you re-enter the workforce, what would make you pick one company over another? Company culture, management style, overall direction? And what if your company gets acquired? Will there be a role for you once the acquisition is complete?

{"id": "369b0e57-e9de-4eae-b339-37006af1f6a2", "name": "COM Radiology and Medical Imaging Interest Group", "slug": "msucomrig", "url": "https://msu.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/msucomrig", "description": "Radiologists and medical imaging are vital to the practice of medicine. Radiology as a field employs unique technologies that enhance diagnosis and cutting-edge techniques that reduce patient harm. Osteopathic Radiologists provide essential access to marginalized and rural patient populations, and Radiology interest groups are well documented to increase interest and improve perceptions. 1,2 The field has several challenges to practice and recruitment that the group can address, including a looming shortage of practitioners and common and harmful myths about the field. 3,4 In addition, the group can host important image-oriented medical education workshops that are useful to students interested in a variety of fields including primary care and surgical specialties, as there are few practitioners that will not order imaging or interact with a radiologist. Finally, Michigan State hosts a robust imaging research community, and this interest group can provide an essential link for getting interested students into the laboratory. The primary mission of this group is to provide a place for exposure, mentorship, and experiential learning for students interested in the fields of Diagnostic Radiology (DR), Interventional Radiology (IR), Radiologic Oncology, and other medical imaging fields. A secondary mission is to provide opportunities for students interested in other fields to learn about medical imaging concepts related to their own field of interest. Osteopathic physicians are the fastest growing portion of medical professionals, with 25% of medical students enrolling at osteopathic medical schools. Osteopathic radiologists provide crucial access to rural and marginalized communities. 1 These are communities that, many times, lack the facilities, equipment, and staff to provide adequate radiologic care. This leaves the populations predominantly served by osteopathic clinicians without timely access to care. Many times, forcing patients to travel hours from home to receive care elsewhere. This is a major opportunity missed by the rural osteopathic physician. By encouraging young osteopathic hopefuls to engage in radiology and inspiring them to pursue this specialty we can bridge a gap for these communities. We can embrace the spirit of those most served by osteopaths by allowing them to receive all care within their own communities. We can comfort the mind by providing them access to radiology services from their trusted osteopathic rural physicians. Radiological technology has steadily evolved to allow diagnosis and treatment while remaining minimally invasive. Otherwise, concealed pathologies can be seen and treated using imaging techniques that allow us to glimpse inside the body without opening the body to the elements of a surgical suite. With this evolution of minimally invasive practice, there has also been a growth in the demand for more outpatient and minimally invasive ways to heal. Radiology has been the centerpiece of this advancement and will remain at the forefront of the evolution of medical treatment. Here at MSU, we are fortunate to be at an emerging center for imaging research. It is our hope that this group will serve as a conduit for interested students to receive world-class training in imaging research should that be their ambition. Key to enticing the young osteopathic student into the field of radiology is through early exposure and education. The Radiology and Medical Imaging Interest Group aims to serve this cause. Our purpose will be to excite and share our love for the field of radiology with our peers and future Osteopathic Physicians. Through workshops, symposiums, and educational sessions, we will instill the importance of radiology and inspire with the advancements and evolution in patient care that is provided by the field. Currently, this major aspect of medicine is not adequately represented by the organizations that are offered at MSUCOM. This is something that was immediately noticed by the four of us and has prompted us to ensure that future hopeful Osteopathic medical students can have their interests nourished. It is further our hope to expose the possibilities of radiology to others who would not have otherwise known what radiology is able to accomplish. We hope that our organization can push more students to become osteopathic radiologists who can provide timely, adequate, and accessible radiologic medical care to the rural and marginalized communities we hold dear.

It is based out of St. John’s Catholic Church and Student Center and offers a variety of events and opportunities for participation throughout the week. In addition to daily mass, adoration, and confession, as well as Sunday masses, St. John’s has “Night Mass” every Tuesday and Thursday at 8:45 PM. This is geared toward the student population and many students use these evenings to socialize with fellow Catholic Spartans after mass. Additional mass times can be found on our website. Catholic Spartans hosts many small group Bible studies in every neighborhood on campus. There are also Greek Life and off-campus Bible studies. These groups promote authentic friendship and community through discussion, study, and application of the Bible and Catholic teachings. For those who desire an even deeper investment in their faith, there are weekly men’s and women’s accountability groups that focus on setting goals to bring participants closer to Sainthood. Catholic Spartans also organizes a multitude of social events (game nights, day trips, spikeball, speaker events, praise and worship nights, etc.) throughout the year for students to attend. These also include two weekend retreats in addition to other day retreats throughout the academic year. Finally, for those interested in giving back, there are many service opportunities for students to take part in. St. John’s offers training and opportunities to serve as an altar server, Eucharistic minister, lector, or sacristan in addition to other liturgical ministries. St. John’s can also connect students with other Catholic and Christian service organizations in a variety of areas. Another way to serve is through our Alternative Spring Break program which sends students on service-oriented mission-trips across the country.
